# The folder stroes all the labeled and unlabeled data used in the paper.
# The labeled data is summarized in a folder with the dispersion data on each grid cell as a text file
# The unlabeled data is stroed in a 3-D matrixs as a npy file 

For the .txt files in it, the name of the file corresponds to its latitude and 360-longitude.

For example, 32.700_243.150.txt corresponds to the dispersion data at 32.7E and 116.85W.
For each .txt file in disp_True_with_uncer.zip, each column corresponds to (5 columns):
Period,     V_phase,      V_group,      Uncertainty_phase,      Uncertainty_group

For each .txt file in other .zip file, each column corresponds to (3 columns):
Period,     V_phase (predicted),     V_group (predicted)


For .npz files
Inv_results_Rinv.npz
Include the Vs model for CVM-H and Vs model from Qiu et al. (2019）， called "vs_final" in the .npz file
